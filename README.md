## UoM G9 Capstone Project

## Design and Implementation of IoT Lake/River Real-Time Depth Monitoring, Hazard Detection and Path Mapping System.

### aims to enable boaters to conduct bathymetric surveys of lakes or rivers and leverage the survey data to enhance their boating experience and safety. Boaters can integrate our device onto their boats to monitor real-time depth and location data via our phone app and upload this data to our database. The app utilizes the database to visualize surveyed areas, provide navigational services for safe routing, and perform hazard differentiation.
